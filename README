Since the day that Ubuntu Gutsy was released it has been including a useful tool that allows package installing directly from the browser by means of "apt://" links:

However, the usage of this tool is not very extended in the web. that's why I've thought of writting a small script for automatically creating apturls

I hope that this script is able to ease the life of GNU/Linux users in Ubuntu (or Debian) who browse the Internet searching for software, tutorials, etc. and find apt-get/aptitude lines all around.

What this script does is to turn lines of text like this:


    sudo apt-get install emacs emacs-goodies-el windows-el jde js2-mode
    aptitude install freepats timidity-interfaces-extra timidity-el tuxguitar
    apt://oneko
    apt:bsdgames,pacman4console,moon-buggy-esd



into clickable links that will launch a graphical installer for each of the packages in the line.
Like this:


    sudo apt-get install emacs emacs-goodies-el windows-el jde js2-mode
    aptitude install freepats timidity-interfaces-extra timidity-el tuxguitar
    apt://oneko
    apt:bsdgames,pacman4console,moon-buggy-esd



If these links don't work for you then it means that you are not using Ubuntu or that you have a Debian derivative that doesn't have the apturl package installed. You can try to install it doing this:


    sudo aptitude install apturl
    # (this might be probably the last time you'll have to copy that on a terminal)
